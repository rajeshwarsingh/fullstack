# Fullstack
Here we will discuss the full-stack Guide and mainly will focus on the MERN STACK.

## MERN - Mongo, Express, React, Node
## Topics to address
- Javascript
- Typescript

- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- Interview Preparation
- DSA
- Architecture
- AI (Generative AI)

## Javascript
* Fundamentals
* ES6 + Latest

### Fundamentals
* JS execution 
* Clouser  
* Hoisting  
* Call, Apply, Bind  
* Scoping (var, let, const)  
      
### ES6 + Latest
* Latest ES Feature (destructuring, map, for in, for of, reducer)

### JS execution

**Spider Monkey (MOZILA)**: This is the first engine.  
**V8 Engine (Chrome)**: Extremely fast and can run standalone, Nodejs js run time uses the v8 engine.  
**Chakra (Edge)**: Microsoft engine Edge and Internet Explorer use it. 

**Compilar vs Interpreter**
> * The compiler compiles the all code into the machine code at once whereas the Interpreter interprets the code line by line.
> * The compiler is slow to write time as it needs to compile the whole before going to execute whereas the interpreter is the opposite.  

### JAVASCRIPT ENGINE    
Here is explained how our js code like var, array, function, etc. will get to machine code(1 and 0).

> * **Parser**  In 1st step Source code goes to a parser that checks the code line by line for any syntax or other error if there is any error it throws the error message and if the code is valid it generates AST(Abstract syntax tree).
> * **AST**  It converts the code into the nodes of the tree like js DOM. You can check this link for details on how it looks  https://astexplorer.net/  
> * **Interpreter**  Next step Interpreter takes the AST and converts it to BYTECODE
> * **Byte Code** It is executed by the JavaScript engine's interpreter or a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which converts the bytecode into machine code that the computer's processor can understand and execute.
> * **Machine Code**  Machine code is the binary(1 and 0) that our computer hardware understands(CPU)
