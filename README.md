- AI (Generative AI)

## Javascript
* Fundamentals
* ES6 + Latest

### Fundamentals
* JS execution 
* Clouser  
* Hoisting  
* Call, Apply, Bind  
* Scoping (var, let, const)  
      
### ES6 + Latest
* Latest ES Feature (destructuring, map, for in, for of, reducer)

### JS execution

**Spider Monkey (MOZILA)**: This is the first engine.  
**V8 Engine (Chrome)**: Extremely fast and can run standalone, Nodejs js run time uses the v8 engine.  
**Chakra (Edge)**: Microsoft engine Edge and Internet Explorer use it. 

**Compilar vs Interpreter**
> * The compiler compiles the all code into the machine code at once whereas the Interpreter interprets the code line by line.
> * The compiler is slow to write time as it needs to compile the whole before going to execute whereas the interpreter is the opposite.  

### JAVASCRIPT ENGINE    
Here is explained how our js code like var, array, function etc. will get to machine code.
